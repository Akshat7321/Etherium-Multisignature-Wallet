Request for transactions.

Any request has to be verified by atleast n users controlling the wallet hence it is also called n of m Wallet.
Work out the transactions according to the decisions made by the wallet Controllers

After its implementation one can expand or reduce the size of wallet controllers

Further the ModifiedSmartContract has new feature which allows user to set the weights of different controllers
Thus every transaction passes with votes distributed as per the weights of the users.
